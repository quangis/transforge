    A transformation can be used to query other transformations: it should then
    capture relevant aspects of the process, as a flowchart of some conceptual
    types and operations that must occur in it. For example, the following
    holds that there must be types `A` and `B` that are fed to an operation `f`
    that eventually results in a type `C`:

        [] a :Task; :output
